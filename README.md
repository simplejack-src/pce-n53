Usage
=====
When applied to the original (uncompressed) ASUS PCE-N53 source drop (dated
2012) this modified source is able to build a STA-only kernel module for the
PCE-N53/Ralink chipset (rt55992sta.ko).

Note: The latest kernel release this has been tested with is:
   [Arch-Linux Mainline] 4.19.2-arch1-1-ARCH 


Manual Build Instructions
=========================
The following environment variables must be set prior to building:
* MODE[=STA]
* TARGET[=LINUX]
* KERN_VER[=[target kernel version]]
* LINUX_SRC[=[target kernel source directory, i.e. kernel headers]]


As a Makefile project, the following commands can be used to clean, build and
install the kernel module respectively:
```
# make clean
# make
# make install
'''

Note: Installing the kernel module may require root privileges

e.g.
```
# export MODE='STA'
# export TARGET='LINUX'
# export KERN_VER='4.19.2-arch1-1-ARCH'
# export LINUX_SRC="/lib/modules/$KERN_VER/build"
# make clean
# make
# make install
```
